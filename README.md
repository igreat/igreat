I'm Mujtaba, a programmer that loves exploring 🚀

I'm also on my journey to become a better human being inshallah 🙏🏾

I also make YouTube videos about the stuff I learn and discover. You'll find me at [@greatfate](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC16BYekiN_0telZ2z_WgtDQ). This channel envelopes my love to inspire others and share what I learned 😌🎥
