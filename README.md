I'm Mujtaba, a programmer that loves exploring 🚀

- 🖥️📏 **I'm an explorer in computer science and mathematics**, often challenging myself in those fields!
- 🤖🧠🦾 **I'm an artificial intelligence (AI) enthusiast**, spending a large portion of my free time exploring the new advancements in AI and strengthening my fundamentals in the field. 
- 🤖📖👁 I'm interested in **Computer Vision** and **Natural Language Processing**, as well as the dream of creating **human level intelligence** 

I also make YouTube videos about the stuff I learn and discover (which is currently all deep learning related!). You'll find me at [@greatfate](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC16BYekiN_0telZ2z_WgtDQ). This channel envelopes my love to inspire others and share what I learned 😌🎥

In my free time, you’ll find me listening to a Lex Fridman’s podcast, reading the latest papers in AI or on occasion watching anime! 🎧📜🤓
